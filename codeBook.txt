#Code Book
The first output of the scripts in a text file called tidyData.txt, which is a data set that includes all instances of data from the training and test data sets.
These instances have their subject and activity number identifier added onto each instance (row) to allow for ease of use for working with. 
The other columns are the three dimension x,y,z axis momentum acceleration mean and standard deviation of the 6 specified activities. 
I chose not to add the actual word for each activity because it is redundant when the numbers associated with them are already present.
This is also because it helps keep the data set clear of extraneous information
